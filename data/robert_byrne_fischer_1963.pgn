1. d4 {Notes from various sources.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 c6
4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5 {5.Qb3 maintains more tension. -- Fischer}
cxd5 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. e3 O-O 8. Nge2 Nc6 9. O-O b6 10. b3 {It's
hard for either side to introduce an imbalance into this
essentially symmetrical variation. Deadeye equality also
ensues afer 10.Nf4 e6 11.b3 Ba6 12.Re1 Rc8 13.Ba3 Re8 14.Rc1
(Stahlberg-Flohr, Kemeri 1937) -- Fischer} Ba6 11. Ba3 {After
White's 11th move I should adjudicate his position as slightly
superior, and at worst completely safe. To turn this into a
mating position in eleven more moves is more witchcraft than
chess! Quite honestly, I do not see the man who can stop Bobby
at this time. -- K.F. Kirby, South African Chess Quarterly}
Re8 12. Qd2 e5 {! I was a bit worried about weakening my QP,
but felt that the tremendous activity obtained by my minor
pieces would permit White no time to exploit it. 12...e6 would
probably lead to a draw. -- Fischer} 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Rfd1
{"Add another to those melancholy case histories entitled: The
Wrong Rook." -- Fischer ~ "This is very much a case of 'the
wrong rook'. One can understand Byrne's desire to break the
pin on the e2-knight, but this turns out to be less important
than other considerations. Fischer spends a lot of time and
energy analysing the superior 14. Rad1!, but still comes to
the conclusion that Black can keep the advantage." -- John
Nunn} Nd3 {Now it's all systems go for the Fischer rocket. --
Robert Wade} 15. Qc2 {There is hardly any other defense to the
threat of ...Ne4. -- Fischer} Nxf2 {! The key to Black's
previous play. The complete justification for this sac does
not become apparent until White resigns! -- Fischer} 16. Kxf2
Ng4+ 17. Kg1 Nxe3 18. Qd2 {Byrne: As I sat pondering why
Fischer would choose such a line, because it was so obviously
lost for Black, there suddenly comes...} Nxg2 {!! This
dazzling move came as the shocker... the culminating
combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at
which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the
play for the spectators in a separate room believed I had a
won game! -- Robert Byrne} 19. Kxg2 d4 {!} 20. Nxd4 Bb7+ {The
King is at Black's mercy. -- Fischer} 21. Kf1 {In a room set
aside for commentaries on the games in progress, two
grandmasters were stating, for the benefit of the spectators,
that Byrne had a won game. Byrne's reply to Fischer's next
move must have been jaw dropping! -- Wade} Qd7 {And White
resigns. Fischer writes: "A bitter disappointment. I'd hoped
for 22.Qf2 Qh3+ 23.Kg1 Re1+!! 24.Rxe1 Bxd4 with mate to follow
shortly."} 0-1
